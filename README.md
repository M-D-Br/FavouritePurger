<h1>Favourite Purger</h1>

Does what it says on the tin. Requires Tweepy, which you can install via pip.

`pip install tweepy`

From there, download the Python file, input the necessary API keys and run it in your terminal.

`python3 favouritepurge.py`

It takes some time to run – adjust the loop value if you have a lot of favourites and don't want to restart every time the loop completes.
